# Lab2-JS-frameworks

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Node.js** and **ES Modules** to import and export functions across multiple JavaScript files. The goal is to practice modular programming by organizing reusable functions in a separate file and calling them from a main script.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **index.js**: The main entry point that imports and calls functions from another module.
- **functions.js**: A utility file containing four different functions performing various tasks.
- **package.json**: Contains project metadata and specifies the use of ES Modules (`"type": "module"`).

## âœ¨ Key Concepts

- Importing and exporting functions using **ES Modules (`import/export`)**.
- Running JavaScript on the **server-side with Node.js**.
- Structuring a project into multiple files for better maintainability.

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works

1. **Functions are defined in `functions.js`**:
   - A function to display a welcome message.
   - A function to convert a unit (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
   - A function to perform a mathematical operation (e.g., factorial).
   - An advanced function of choice.
2. **The main file (`index.js`) imports these functions and calls them**.
3. The project is executed using Node.js.
